# Colony Counter

## Description

A web-based image viewer with support for counting objects on the image. The current flow is planned as follows:

## V1 Plans

* Drag file (image) onto the viewer
* View info about the file (name, date(?) size)
* Allow clicking on the image to drop small markers
* Clicking a marker a second time deletes the marker
* Overall count of the number of markers

## Desirable Features

* Allow changing the opacity of all the markers via a slider
* Allow zooming in/out in the image (and have the points reflect the zoom)
* Export data as xml / some other format
* Storage/memory of previous images (based on a hash of the file)
* Undo/Redo functionality
* allow specifying markers of your choice

# Tasks:

* fix exact click coordinates
* implement sliders for image and maker opacities
